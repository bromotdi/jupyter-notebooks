# Python Advanced Topics

## Introduction ðŸ‘‹

### In this tutorial, you will learn about:

#### Python Iterators: 
They are objects that can be iterated upon. In this tutorial, you will learn how iterator functions and how you can build your own iterator using __iter__ and __next__ methods.

#### Python Generators:
It make iterations easily using Python generators, how it is not quite the same as iterators and normal functions, and why you should use it.

#### Python closure: 
How to define a closure, and the reasons you should use it.

#### Python Decorators:
A decorator takes in a function, includes some functionality, and brings it back. In this tutorial, you will learn how you can make a decorator and why you should use it.

#### Python @property decorator:
Python programming provides us an inherent @property decorator which makes utilization of getter and setters a lot simpler in Object-Oriented Programming.

#### Python RegEx: 
In this tutorial, you will find out about regular expressions (RegEx), and use Pythonâ€™s re module to work with RegEx (with the help of examples).
